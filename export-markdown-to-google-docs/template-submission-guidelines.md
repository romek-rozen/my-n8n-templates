## ‚òëÔ∏è¬†Guidelines

<aside>
üì£ tl;dr: make sure the template is relevant to a broad enough group, well annotated so it‚Äôs clear what it does, and has some clear set up steps (via sticky, video, notion doc etc)

</aside>

- All your content should be written in English and spelled correctly
- **Provide a detailed description**: Provide a concise and informative description outlining the template's functionality and expected outcomes. Include a brief setup guide for user convenience. A detailed description not only clarifies the template's purpose but also enhances its discoverability through SEO. It‚Äôs advised to use these sections in your description:
    - Who is this for?
    - What problem is this workflow solving? / use case
    - What this workflow does
    - Setup
    - How to customize this workflow to your needs
    - Use Markdown formatting
    - Use ## H2 headlines for sections
- **Optimize for SEO**:
    1. Use the main nodes in the title and use sentence-style capitalization, e.g. `One-way sync between Pipedrive and HubSpot` or `Create an invoice in Google Sheets based on Typeform submission`
    2. Try to have a description with ~ 200 words
    3. Use H2 headers to structure your description into sections

- **Rename your workflow‚Äôs nodes** to explain what that step is doing. Workflow notes are a handy feature as are [Sticky notes](https://docs.n8n.io/workflows/components/sticky-notes/).

- **Add a Sticky note that explains what the template does** and any dependencies required.
    - If you have an external setup guide, like a notion page, link it here too.
    - You are a rockstar if you also make a quick setup video üë©‚Äçüé§. [Loom recordings](http://loom.com) are a simple way to go. You don‚Äôt have to be a pro Youtuber, simple videos are still really helpful. Plus our community will really appreciate it ü•∞
    - Use different sticky colors

![Always include a sticky note that explains the workflow](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/d147bfac-0bab-4c58-884f-f45c5f5a13e8/d66a8247-8f03-4a3d-92d4-5b5ad617caa9/Screenshot_2023-12-22_at_12.01.38.png)

Always include a sticky note that explains the workflow

- When adding a template with a community node, please add a disclaimer to the top of your description that your template is only available on self-hosted. Also, make sure to add an image of your workflow to the top of your description, as we don‚Äôt show previews for community node templates.

## üëç¬†Additional Tips

- Try to use an `edit fields` node that allows users to set all their variables in one node
- Try to empathize with a user who is attempting to use your template. Keep in mind that they may not know as much about n8n as you do.
